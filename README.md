## Harvest List
[Harvest List][heroku] is a social media marketplace app for chefs to follow the farms they work with, and for farmers to quickly update their inventory.

## Motivation
Harvest List is my final project for the Code Immersion web development course at Tech Talent South, Raleigh. I wanted to make something that I thought would be useful to communities I was familiar with. I have previously worked at [farms](http://www.fourleaffarm.org/) and restaurants, and thought this could be a tool to streamline the process selling produce and buying ingredients.
