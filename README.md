## Harvest List
[Harvest List][heroku] is a social media marketplace app for chefs to follow the farms they work with, and for farmers to quickly update their inventory.

## Motivation
Harvest List is my final project for the Code Immersion web development course at Tech Talent South, Raleigh. I wanted to make something that I thought would be useful to communities I was familiar with. I have previously worked at [farms](http://www.fourleaffarm.org/) and restaurants, and thought this could be a tool to streamline the process selling produce and buying ingredients.

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
To run locally, clone the repository and `cd` into the app's directory. Within the directory on the command line run `bundle install` to install the gem file dependencies. Then start the server with `rails server`.


## How to use?
As you sign up you choose a `role`, a seller or a buy, which would be a farmer or chef, respectively. As a farmer you have the ability to upload new products. As a chef you have the ability to to follow farmers to create a feed of new products from the farms you follow, as well as the ability to buy those products.



## Credits
This project was completed under the tutelage of Brian Sowers and Tech Talent South, Raleigh. I had help from Andrew Dally deploying the app to [Heroku][heroku] and Amazon S3.
